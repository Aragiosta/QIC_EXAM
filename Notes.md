# General notes and ideas for QIC final project

Just a dump of things popping up.

# ToDo for the project-code:
- ED:
1. check interaction matrix of the paper model, seems too strong nnn interactions - done
2. average over different runs - done
3. plot everything - done
4. correct entanglement spectrum - done
5. time analysis - done
- MPS:
1. run everything and save what needed - done
2. check against ED
4. correct entanglement spectrum - done
5. time analysis - done
6. How to use DMRG? No boundary conditions? Extend size? Other? - done
7. String parameters - done
- JW:
1. Analytic predictions
2. fidelity of eigvecs?


# Standard things to put into the presentation:
1. recreated graphs for the spectrum, for the occupation number at the edges etc. etc.
2. Analysis of the code with the 7 points discussed in class
3. Physics involved - the long range correlators and the entanglement spectrum
# Interesting things to put into the presentation:
1. surely times of the code, to show bottlenecks
2. edge effects as size grows
3. fermionic number
4. hardcore bosons vs pauli?
