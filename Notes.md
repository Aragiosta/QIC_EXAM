# General notes and ideas for QIC final project

Just a dump of things popping up.

# Standard things to put into the presentation:
1. recreated graphs for the spectrum, for the occupation number at the edges etc. etc.
2. 
# Interesting things to put into the presentation:
1. surely times of the code, to show bottlenecks
2. edge effects as size grows
3. fermionic number
4. hardcore bosons vs pauli?
